# Turning a pdf table into a DataFrame

When first starting to learn how to use R, I got interested in turning a pdf table into a data frame. For that purpose, I used the University of Maine System report listing salaries of all regular employees. The posted scripts read the pdf, turn it into an RData data frame and produce several summary analysis plots. The entire point of this excercise was my curiosity. As I look back on it, after several years, I am glad to see my coding skills have significantly improved.
